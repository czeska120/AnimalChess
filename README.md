Before the start of a game, each player picks one animal piece. The one with the higher-ranked animal is the first player. The players will choose a color for their animal pieces (e.g. Player 1 chooses red, Player 2 chooses blue). The players take turns in moving their animal pieces on the board. The game ends when a player successfully moves any of his animal pieces into his opponents animal den.

  Generally,
  * pieces can move one space horizontally or vertically; and
  * pieces may land on and capture an opponent's piece that has equal or lower rank.
  
  However, the following exceptions apply:
  __Movement__
  * The _mouse_ is the only animal that is allowed to move on the river.
  * Both the _lion_ and the _tiger_ can jump from the land before the river to the land after the river, horizontally or vertically, as long as there is no _mouse_ along the way.
  * A player __may not__ move his own piece into his own animal den.
  
  __Capturing an opponent's piece__
  * A player may capture an opponent's piece with a higher rank that is on one of his traps.
  * An _elephant_ __may not__ capture a _mouse_, while the _mouse_ can capture an _elephant_.
  * A _mouse_ on the river __may not__ capture an _elephant_, or another _mouse_ on land.
  * A _mouse_ on the river may capture another _mouse_ on the river.
  * A _mouse_ on land __may not__ capture a _mouse_ on the river.
